## About Me

### I Love Building for the Web, Mobile, and Embedded Systems.

My passion lies in building elegant solutions across diverse domains. I spend my time crafting intuitive user experiences on the web, primarily using JavaScript, while also leveraging Python for Data Analysis and Algorithms. Additionally, I enjoy experimenting with system-level applications, where I prefer the C programming language, and creating side-projects on mobile.

Take a look around my repositories to see some of my work. If you're building something cool or just want to chat about engineering and design, feel free to connect!
